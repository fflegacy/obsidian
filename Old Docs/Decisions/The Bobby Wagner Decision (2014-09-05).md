> [!info] This page contains an official commissioner decision, including justifications and consequences. All decisions are written from the perspective of Commissioner Dan.

#### Background information

Yahoo had incorrectly noted that the following players were Out:
- Bobby Wagner
- Morgan Burnett

As a result, Chris had dropped Bobby Wagner for Andy Mulumba, and Michael had benched Morgan Burnett. Both of these players had played in the Seahawks/Packers game on September 4, 2014.

#### Decision Summary

- Chris will not be refunded his points for Week 1 regarding Bobby Wagner (23 points) or Andy Mulumba (0 points).
- Chris will drop Andy Mulumba for Bobby Wagner starting Week 2. This will not remove the original transaction from the record.
- This transaction will not affect Chris's waiver priority.
- Michael will not be afforded the option to start Morgan Burnett for Week 1.

I'm willing to compromise on the transaction affecting Chris's waiver priority i.e. dropping it from 6 to 10. If interested, we can put this to an owners vote, requiring 7/10 to pass.

As a note, once a player scores points I **will not** make decisions that retroactively award or remove those points for that week. After a player scores the expected value of that player is altered, and any owner motives involving his player status are compromised.

#### Acting on Misinformation

The main purpose of this decision is to serve as a warning for those acting on misinformation. In this case, Yahoo assumed a role as a definitive source on player information -- one that would reflect "official" sources -- and Yahoo was wrong in the information it distributed. We can no longer make this assumption regarding Yahoo's information accuracy.

As such, the new expectation is to base decisions on several sources, both official and unofficial. Going forward, if any owner were to act on misinformation of any kind, they will not be awarded reparations for their decision. As a league, we may procure some recommended resources for all to use, but **we can no longer assume any source is definitive**.

Additionally, I will be checking everyone's point totals each week to insure their accuracy. This is why [this repository](https://github.com/bergren2/fflegacy) is the official record for our league, to safeguard against third parties. In this case, I no longer trust Marissa Mayer and Yahoo to make decisions that are in the best interests of this league.

#### Judging a Team Owner's Decisions

As commissioner, I cannot pass judgment on whether an owner's decision was good or bad. My role is only to insure a fair environment for competition. Misinformation sown throughout this league's research tools does not constitute a fair environment and **will not** be tolerated.

#### The Can't Cut List

The Yahoo-provided Can't Cut list does not include defensive players. Also it's run by Yahoo, who we have established we do not trust. If anyone has ideas for how we want to revise this, please let me know. I will take a closer look at it in the coming week.

#### Summary

At the time of this decision, Yahoo had provided misinformation regarding linebacker Bobby Wagner and 
safety Morgan Burnett, and any decisions stemming from this misinformation should be reversed to the extent that can fairly be allowed. I cannot reverse points that have already been realized, but I can act to prevent any further consequences.

I will also be taking further steps to prevent misinformed decisions from occurring in the future.
