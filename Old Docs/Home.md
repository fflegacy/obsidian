### Yahoo

We are using Yahoo to manage our league. You can find our league at the following URL: [http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/league/fflegacy](http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/league/fflegacy)

While Yahoo already has details on many of the rules in this rulebook, we keep a copy here written in plain English so everyone has a firm understanding of what's going on.
