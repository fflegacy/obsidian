The League is comprised of two 5-team divisions. The regular season lasts 13 weeks, during which time each team will play other teams in its division twice, and one of the teams in the opposite division once. See the [scheduling](Scheduling.md) page for info on how this is determined.

At the end of the regular season, 3 weeks of playoff matches commence. The division winners will grab the 1st and 2nd seeds in the playoffs, earning themselves a 1st-week playoff bye. The other four playoff teams (wildcards) will be seeded from the overall league standings. All of this is handled automatically by Yahoo.

### Records

If two or more teams tie records, the [tiebreaker rules](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/fantasy-football/head-to-head-tiebreakers-sln6447.html) are as follows:

#### Division Leader Tie
1. Division win percentage.
2. Total season fantasy points.
3. Fantasy points scored in previous week's matchup.
4. Fantasy points scored in the matchup two weeks prior.
5. The comparison continues until the tie is broken or no more weeks remain to compare. At that time, a coin flip will settle the tie.

#### Wildcard Tie

Same as the division leader tie, except division win percentage is not used as a tiebreaker.

**Win percentage** is calculated as follows:

(Wins + [Ties * 0.5])  /  Total Games Played
