Trading is an integral part of any fantasy league. In the FFLL we have the following stipulations:

* Trades can be made for next year's draft picks in addition to players.
* Draft picks must be traded 1-for-1 e.g. a first round draft pick can be traded for a player **and** a last round draft pick.
* During the off-season, players cannot be traded.
* Managers have two (2) days to veto a pending trade.
* Trades are overturned when at least four (4) managers veto the trade.
* **November 12, 2016** is the last day to trade for the 2016-2017 season.
