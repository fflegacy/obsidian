This league uses [game-time waivers](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/game---tuesday-sln7129.html) i.e. a player gets added to the Waiver Wire once their game starts until the Waiver Period ends on Tuesday at 11:59 Pacific Time.

When a player is dropped, they get added to the Waiver Wire and are kept there for a minimum of 1 day. That player can be kept on the Waiver Wire for more than one day if their game for that week has already started.

*Exception:* A player dropped on Wednesday who has a Thursday night game will move off the Waiver Wire that Thursday.

### Examples

- Player dropped on Friday, spends Saturday on Waiver Wire, resolves Sunday morning before his game
- Player dropped on Saturday, spends Sunday on Waiver Wire, resolves Wednesday morning since his game was on Sunday
- Player dropped Monday before game, resolves Wednesday morning at the end of Weekly Waiver Period
- Owner tries to drop player after MNF starts, fails
- Player dropped Wednesday, resolves Thursday morning in time for game that night
- Player dropped Wednesday, resolves Thursday even though his game is on Sunday
