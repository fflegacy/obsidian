The 2014 draft will be a snake draft with the order determined randomly by Yahoo.

## Subsequent Drafts

#### Lottery
The four teams that do not make the playoffs in the previous year will enter a lottery to determine their positions for the first two rounds of the draft. Their chances are as follows:

* 7th Place Regular Season: 40%
* 8th Place Regular Season: 30%
* 9th Place Regular Season: 20%
* 10th Place Regular Season: 10%

Once the first four positions are determined, the rest are chosen in the reverse order of the playoff standings, with the regular season record working as a tie-breaker (i.e. the worse record gets a higher pick).

Starting with the third round, the draft will once again be a snake draft, with the order determined by the second round.

#### Keepers

For picks that have been "occupied" by keepers, the keeper will automatically be selected and the round will continue. See the [keepers page](Keepers.md) for more details.
