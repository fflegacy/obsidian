# 2020 Season

## Minimum Viable Season
The League requires a minimum of 9 weeks for a complete season to guarantee everyone plays everyone else at least once.

- This means 9 complete _fantasy_ games e.g. if the league ended Monday morning on Week 9 but no one started any players that night, we'd consider that a complete season.

Should the NFL cancel the season before 9 weeks of fantasy football are completed, competition will immediately cease and all dues will be refunded according to the Prize Payouts rules below.

## Playoffs
All rounds of the playoffs must complete for them to both determine prize payouts for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and top unplaced AND draft order for 2021.

If the playoffs do not start or are only partially completed, season rankings will be used instead to determine payouts for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.

## Prize Payouts
In the event the season is cut short:
1. League will pay out completed feat weeks up until season end
2. If at least 9 complete fantasy weeks were played, then the top four prizes are paid out (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th / top unplaced)
3. If any prize money is leftover (e.g. playoff payouts, unplayed feat weeks), the remaining balance will be refunded evenly among league owners

## 2021 Draft Order
If we get a minimum viable season, then that will be used to determine the draft order for 2021.

If the season is not viable, a random drawing will determine the order.
